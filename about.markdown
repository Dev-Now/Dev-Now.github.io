My name is Ghazi Majdoub. I am a senior software engineer and researcher with over 12 years of professional experience across two industries.

I worked in the aircraft simulation industry for approximately 7 years, contributing to the design and development of multiple aircraft simulation models including the A350, B777X, and CRJ900. Following that, I transitioned to full-stack web development for clinical research and data capture, where I have worked for over 5 years. Notable projects include DICOM image PACS and viewer integration, and webhooks design and implementation for a clinical research suite.

Currently, I regularly design and build - on the side - solutions for automation, productivity and education, using various technologies including agentic AI, LLMs, open dedicated AI models, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). There is mostly a research and exploration side to these new personal projects.

I use various skills and programming languages including:
- **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript, Python, C#, and C++.
- **Frontend:** Vue
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL
- **DevOps:** Docker
- **Automation:** n8n

My open-source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Dev-Now).
