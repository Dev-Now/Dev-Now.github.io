My name is Ghazi Majdoub. I am a senior programmer analyst at Dacima Software (Montreal, Canada). I worked as a senior Aircraft Simulator developper for 7 years before the covid-19 pandemic.

For the past 9 years, I have successfully completed innovative and challenging projects collaborating with highly skilled teams. For more details about my career, please check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghazi-majdoub-64401838).

I am fond of software design and development, and I am an experienced C++ programmer. As a simulation developer, I contributed in the design and development of many aircraft simulation models (B777X, A350, CRJ900, etc.) in C++. I also built a variety of useful tools in Python and C#. With Dacima, I switched to the amazing Big Data world and became an ASP.NET EDC (Electronic Data Capture) platform programmer. I enjoy spending my weekends on making new Software too; Check out my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/G_M_Dev/projects) and [Github](https://github.com/Dev-Now) projects.

I’m also obsessed with reading, and I read in three languages; Arabic, English and French (Much more in Arabic and English than French… Hard to find staff that interest me in French these days!). This love for reading developed in me a growing love for research and writing. Topics I care about most are (among others): Software Design, AI, Machine Learning, Security and Privacy, Education, …

Welcome to my personal website! Here you can find all my work in Software design, Research, Robotics, Education … I post my writings about my topics of interest also here! And everything is all open for everyone. Enjoy!
